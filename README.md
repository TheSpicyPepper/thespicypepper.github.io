Helping my musician friend Ryan out by setting him up with a site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

He's very new to this stuff, so I'm trying to teach him a little bit about HTML so he can make minor modifications to his site, at the very least.

## Contributing

This project uses the [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) build system for all of it's tasks. You'll need Node and optionally Ruby if you'd like to work on the CSS.

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp # If you don't already have Gulp installed globally
$ npm install
```

The main task you'll be interested in is `gulp serve` which will build all of the files under `src/` and serve them up in the browser at [localhost:80](http://localhost).

From there it's just a matter of expanding upon the existing content.

Happy coding!
