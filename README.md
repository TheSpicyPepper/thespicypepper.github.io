Helping my musician friend Ryan out by setting him up with a site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). It's nothing extravagant &ndash; I'm not even using any of my favorite utilities like Gulp, Sass or NPM &ndash; just a webpage where he can display his music.

I want this to be as simple as possible so Ryan can learn a bit about what goes on behind the scenes of a website, and so he isn't overwhelmed by all the different things I use in my normal build process.
